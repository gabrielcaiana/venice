### Generating icons assets based on the Fontello configuration

1.  Since this is a entirely manual process, make sure you have the `config.json` published from `venice-icons` on the project.
2.  Grab the `config.json` and drop it on the [Fontello console](http://fontello.com/) to load the icon library.
3.  Click on `Download webfont` button and wait for it.
4.  For projects that deals with the DOM, overwriting the following files on the directory should be enough.
    - `jsm-icons.css`
    - `jsm-icons.woff`
    - `jsm-icons.woff2`
5.  On mobile applications using `react-native`, according to the two operating systems we are developing for:

    - **Android**: Add the `.ttf` file on Android folder, inside the respective app. Follow this path to find the file:
      `apps > app-folder > android > app > src > main > assets > fonts`
    - **iOS**: In the `Icon` component, present in `~packages/uikit`, replace the `config.json` file and the `.ttf` font file.

### Adding new icons

1. Grab the `config.json` and drop it on the [Fontello console](http://fontello.com/) to load the icon library.
2. Drop it the SVG file on the Fontello console and select to add it to the library.
3. Also, store the `.svg` files on the `assets` directory for backup.
4. When you are done, download **only** the `config.json`, overwrite the one in Venice and release a new version.
5. **IMPORTANT** Dont forget to select all the icons before download.

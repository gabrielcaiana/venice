3. Click on `Download webfont` button and wait for it.
4. For projects that deals with the DOM, overwriting the following files on the directory should be enough.
    - `jsm-icons.css`
    - `jsm-icons.woff`
    - `jsm-icons.woff2`
5. On mobile applications using `react-native`, use the `config.json` with `react-native-vector-icons` and `.ttf` generated font file.

### Adding new icons
